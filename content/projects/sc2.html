<h2> Summary </h2>
<p>
  <b><i>Split computing</i></b> has been attracting attentions from the research community as an intermediate option 
  between local (mobile) computing and full computation offloading.
  This approach is effective especially for resource-constrained edge computing systems 
  e.g., computationally weak mobile devices, limited wireless communication capacity.
  We proposed introducing <i>bottleneck</i> (splitting point) to deep learning models at their early stages so that 
  we can minimize local computing and data communication costs while maximizing model accuracy, which we formulated later
  as <b><i>supervised compression for split computing (SC2)</i></b>.
</p>
<p>
  We define <b><i>supervised compression</i></b> as <i>learning compressed representations for supervised downstream tasks</i>.
  It is very challenging to introduce bottlenecks (splitting points) to deep learning models at their early layers while preserving model accuracy.
  SC2 is a key to achieve efficient and accuracy machine learning applications for resource-constrained edge computing systems.

<h2>ML OSS</h2>
<p>
  To facilitate research on supervised compression for split computing (SC2), I published an installable Python package named 
  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sc2bench/" target="_blank">sc2bench</a> (i.e., "pip3 install sc2bench") and <a href="https://github.com/yoshitomo-matsubara/sc2benchmark" target="_blank">a code repository</a> 
  to reproduce the experimental results reported in our SC2 paper.
