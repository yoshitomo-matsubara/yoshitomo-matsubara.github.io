<h2> Summary </h2>
<p>
  Building effective, efficient information retrieval (IR) systems is important and challenging, and such systems are indispensable for our daily lives. 
  We need to be aware of latency, accuracy, contents, misinformation, and more. 
  Information retrieval is also an essential component of question answering (QA) systems. Especially for Web-based QA systems,
  we retrieve relevant documents from tons of web articles by ranking them given a query, and extracting correct answers from such a large search space is challenging.
