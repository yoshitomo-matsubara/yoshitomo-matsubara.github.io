<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Symbolic regression is an approach to explain observed data, using symbolic expressions. 
  Compared to deep-learning-based black-box methods, those expressions are relatively human understandable, which is critical 
  especially when non-machine-learning (ML) experts apply ML to problems in their research domains such as physics, chemistry, and material science.
  We discuss the potential of symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) applications, proposing new SRSD datasets and evaluation metrics.
