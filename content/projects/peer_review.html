<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Peer review systems play an important role in the research community to maintain quality of scientific publications.
  I want to discuss and improve the current peer review systems for research communities that struggle from too many submissions 
  to review in tight schedules and the limited availability of quality reviewers and (senior) area chairs.
